		"Executive Summary": "Electronic Monitoring (EM) allows staff to monitor the activities of pre- and post-adjudicated individuals in the community through house arrest, curfew monitoring, alcohol consumption monitoring, or the monitoring of an individual's movement in the community. Utilizing EM and Global Positioning Software (GPS) technology to monitor the movements of justice involved adults within the community has proven to be a reliable, cost-effective way to sanction individuals and reinforce public safety and the safety of victims.",
		"Program Summary": "EM technologies are useful case management tools that allow for a broader range of responses to non-conformance and an alternative to more expensive incarceration during pre-adjudication and post-conviction. EM allows Parole-Probation Officers (PPO) to know where high risk justice involved adults are located at any given time. This alternative sanction expands supervision sentencing options for judges and creates cost-effective client management by having the individual pay a portion of the equipment costs (based upon subsidy eligibility). Current data indicate most defendants and justice involved adults on EM complete their obligation successfully. Last year, DCJ clients were on EM instead of using nearly 60,000 jail bed days.",

Maintenance staff perform preventative maintenance and smaller scale upgrades/enhancements on the bridges.

Other wage theft is intentional, and often harms workers who may not report it for fear of losing their jobs.

It focuses on countywide risk exposures, liability/subrogation claims, property claims, purchasing insurance, loss control/prevention, and assists departments in managing identified risks.  ",
		"Program Summary": "Each year, the Property & Liability Risk Program (P&LRP) seeks to determine the County's \"Cost of Risk\", benchmark against other entities and continually improve the program by implementing best practices. The (P&LRP) purchases property insurance, marine coverage, crime coverage, excess liability, excess medical malpractice coverage, bonds, and other specialized insurance coverage for the County. Where the cost of insurance prohibits purchase or coverage is not available, we self fund losses. The P&LRP recommends the types/limits of insurance for contracts, recommends the purchase of specialized insurance and develops countywide policies and procedures related to loss prevention and control. The P&LRP designs and implements risk management strategies for the prevention of risk exposure and property and liability loss countywide. The program adjusts property loss claims, and oversees the Third Party Administrator contracted to process general liability insurance claims for the County. Litigation and large general liability insurance claims are settled with expertise from the County Attorney's Office. The County chooses to \"self-insure\" (retain a certain amount of financial exposure to loss) and purchases property and excess liability coverage for large property and liability related claims. This decision controls the loss adjustment process, minimizes our \"total cost of risk\" (uninsured claims costs + insurance costs + administrative costs), and motivates internal loss control behavior. A department's internal property and liability allocated charges are based on their past losses using actuarial data and historical loss data to determine cost percentage rates based on anticipated future losses.",

GPD is currently in the process of purchasing body worn cameras for all GPD patrol officers.  Dramatic increases in prosecutors\u2019 offices personnel costs are being experienced nationwide.",
		"Program Summary": "Primary among the duties of a deputy district attorney is to review cases submitted by local law enforcement agencies to determine whether the case should be charged as a crime.  This function is at the heart of the prosecution function.  The charging decision in every case is guided by a 22-step analysis contained within the MCDA Policy Manual.  As the case progresses through the system, the video may need to be re-reviewed, redacted, reformatted, and used in trial preparation and witness preparation.Police departments across the United States are phasing in the use of body warn cameras.  The Gresham Police Department has instituted an aggressive timeline for equipping their officers with body-worn cameras. Conservative estimates state that 1.5 hours of video will be created by a police officer on every shift.  Of this 1.5 hours, 10% will contain video pertinent to a criminal case \u2013 video that must be reviewed prior to charging and must be reproduced and given to the defense after charging.Body-worn camera evidence will be reviewed by a deputy district attorney.  Duplication and distribution of body-worn camera evidence will be accomplished by non-lawyer staff.  A review of comparably-sized offices from around the country has shown that, with the adoption of body-warn cameras by law enforcement, prosecutor\u2019s personnel costs rose between 3% \u2013 10%.  For example, the Wayne County District Attorney\u2019s Office (Detroit, MI) experienced an 8% increase in personnel costs after several of their law enforcement partners began using body-worn cameras.Data from body-worn cameras will be voluminous and secure storage will be necessary to comply with witness/victim privacy concerns as well as Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) compliance requirements.Body-worn camera footage will allow prosecutors to view crime scenes and witness/victim/suspect interviews through an unfiltered lens.  Transparency and system confidence will increase by virtue of additional objective evidence available for subsequent review.

SIU investigations take them into areas considered hazardous to health and public safety. Investigations conducted by the SIU detectives have resulted in indictments and prosecutions in numerous meth lab cases. SIU coordinates clean-up of drug labs. With the changing needs and priorities of the communities, SIU has modified its mission over the past several years to accommodate the significant impacts of Methamphetamine and other dangerous drugs infesting neighborhoods, schools, recreational areas and work places.
